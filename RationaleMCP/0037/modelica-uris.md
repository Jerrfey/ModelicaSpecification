# Modelica URIs

The Modelica URI format is extended to give meaning to the forms described below.  (Examples and more details were included in the old email thread, and might be of interest to also include here.)

A Modelica URI can be divided into two main parts: a reference to a Modelica class, followed by a resource specified relative to the class.  In terms of generic URI syntax, the class reference is given by the first part of the URI's _path_ — except for the current Modelica URIs, where the class reference is given by the _host_ part (occupying the entire _autority_).  A varying number of path segments are used to specify the class, but one can always immediately tell where the class reference part ends and where the class-relative resource part begins.

## Class reference
Below, "…" represent the class-relative resource part of the Modelica URI, [described below](class-relative-resource).  These are the different ways of referencing a class, where the _host_, _fullclass_, and _relclass_ represent a Modelica class reference (that is, Modelica identifiers, separated by the period charater, and hence free of the path separator that would have to be percent-encoded if present inside a quoted identifier):
- _modelica://host/…_ (non-empty host) — This is the form defined today, becoming deprecated as of this MCP.
  * Example: _modelica://Modelica.Electrical.Analog/media/foo.png_
- _modelica:///fullclass…_ — Class given by its fully qualified name, without leading period.
  * Example: _modelica:///Modelica.Electrical.Analog/media/foo.png_
- _modelica:///./relclass…_ — Class given by lookup of _relclass_ in the class tree — requires class tree context.
  * Example: _modelica:///./Examples/media/foo.png_
  * Example: _modelica:///.//media/foo.png_ (empty _relclass_)
  * Example: _modelica:///.?figure=Disturbances&plot=Wind_ (empty _relclass_)
- _modelica:///~/relclass…_ — This is a reference with class lookup from the point of the nearest enclosing encapsulated class, or the current top level class in case there is no enclosing encapsulated class.  For the MSL, where class encapsultion is currently not used much at all, this provides a convenient way to access resources organized in a hierarchy which is separate from the package hierarchy.
  * Example: _modelica:///~//media/foo.png_ (empty _relclass_)
  * Example: _modelica:///~/Documentation?view=info#introduction_

As demonstrated by the forms above, this scheme can easily be extended with other ways of referring to a class by giving meaning to some new special content of the first path segment that cannot be mistaken for a _fullclass_.

The forms containing _relclass_ are referred to as the _lookup-based forms_ (of a Modelica URI).  The form with _fullclass_ is referred to as the _fully qualified form_ (of a Modelica URI).

Note that the lookup-based forms can only be used in a context where a class tree context is given.  It is an error if _relclass_ doesn't resolve to a class within the same top level package as that of the lookup context — references to resources in a different top level package must use the fully qualified form.  This context can be given in one of two ways:
- A string literal appearing in a Modelica class definition, and in a position where a Modelica URI is given special meaning.  This generally excludes Modelica string literals denoting normal Modelica `String` values — a Modelica tool does not need to keep track of the origin of all string values in the form of Modelica URIs in order to be able to perform lookup.  Instead, it is in the context of certain annotations that a string literal can be in a position where a Modelica URI is expected, as in the `href` of an `a` tag in the `Documentation` annotation.
- The [`resolveURI` operator](resolve-uri.md), also introduced by this MCP.

## Class-relative resource

This section is divided into one subsection for each type of resource being referenced.  Here, _current class_ refers to the class referenced by the class part of the Modelica URI (not the class giving context to a relative class reference).

### External resource

An _external resource_ is a file stored in a structure reflecting the Modelica class hierarchy of the current class.  The resource is specified using the rest of the URI path part, for example:
- _modelica:///Modelica.Electrical.Analog/media/foo.png_

Here, the _media/foo.png_ is a relative file system path that is resolved within a resource directory associated with the current class.  The details of this mapping for the deprecated _host_ form of a Modelica URI are omitted here; the following only applies to the non-deprecated forms, when the current Modelica package is stored in a file system hierarchy:
- The fully qualified class name (after resolving any _relclass_ with respect to the class tree context) is mapped to a nested directory structure, with the constant directory name _resources.d_ (alternatively _package-resources_) appended.
- The relative file system path is relative to _resources.d_ and may not resolve to a location outside _resources.d_.

In the example Modelica URI above, assume `Modelica` is stored in _/Users/jdoe/modelica-packages/Modelica-4.0/Modelica_.  Then, the resolved external resource is:
- _/Users/jdoe/modelica-packages/Modelica-4.0/Modelica/Electrical/Analog/resources.d/media/foo.png_

Note that the mapping of the fully qualified class name to a directory is the same regardless of whether the package itself uses a directory hierarchy for storage — the directory hierarchy for external resoruces is fixed, and it is only one of several options for the package itself to be stored in the same hierarchy.

### Class view

Different views of a class can be specified by using the `view` query:
- _modelica://classref?view=diagram_ — Class diagram.
- _modelica://classref?view=icon_ — Class icon.
  * Example: `<img src="modelica:///.?view=icon" alt="class icon"/>` (icon of the current class)
- _modelica://classref?view=text_ — Textual class source code.
- _modelica://classref?view=info_ — Class documentation.  The fragment specifier can be used to reference a link anchor (present in the `Documentation.info` of the current class).
  * Example: _modelica:///Modelica.Electrical.Analog?view=info#overview_

### Figure and plot

In the event that ([MCP-0033](https://github.com/modelica/ModelicaSpecification/pull/2482)) is accepted before this MCP, a figure is referenced using its `identifier` in the `figure` query.
  * Example: _modelica:///Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Examples.Rectifier?figure=voltcurr_

To reference a plot inside a figure, one can also use the `plot` query (note that the `plot` identifier is only meaningful within a given figure).
  * Example: _modelica:///Modelica.Electrical.Analog.Examples.Rectifier?figure=voltcurr&plot=sumc1c2_

Note that inheritance of figures means that the `figure` identifier is not necessarily referring to a figure defined in the current class, but could come from one of its parent classes.

While the example above was using the _fullclass_ form of a Modelica URI, the most common place where a figure is references is probably in the documentation or other figures of the current class.  Then, using a lookup-based form makes the class more self-contained.
  * Example: _modelica:///.?figure=voltcurr&plot=sumc1c2_ (appearing in the `Documentation.info` of the current class)

**It would be great if the path could be omitted with it's just a period.**
