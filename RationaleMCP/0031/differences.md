# Semantical differences between Flat Modelica and Modelica
This document describes differences between Flat Modelica and Modelica that aren't clear from the differences in the grammars.

## Unbalanced if-equations
In Flat Modelica, all branches of an `if`-equation must have the same number of scalarized equations,
and if there is no `else` all branches must have zero scalarized equations.

An `if`-equation without `else` is useful for a conditional `assert` and similar checks.

### Change and reason for the change
In Modelica this restriction only applies for `if`-equations with non-parameter conditions.
For `if`-equations with parameter condition it does not hold, and if the number of scalarized equations 
differ those parameters have to be evaluated. In practice it can be complicated to separate those cases, 
and some tools attempt to evaluate the parameters even if the branches have the same number of scalarized equations.

Flat Modelica is designed to avoid such implicit evaluation of parameters, and thus this restriction is necessary.

In Modelica a separate issue is that `if`-equations may contain connect and similar primitives 
that cannot easily be counted; but they are gone in Flat Modelica.

## Array dimensions with parameter variability
In Flat Modelica, an array dimension is allowed to have `parameter` variability, that is, the dimension isn't known until after solving the initialization problem in the simulation.  _TO BE ELABORATEDâ€¦_
