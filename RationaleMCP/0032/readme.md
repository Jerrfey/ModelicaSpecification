**(In Development)**

The minutes of _Modelica Design Meetings_ discussing this MCP are summarized in [`minutes.md`](minutes.md).

## Summary

Initial version based on the paper [Modelica language extensions for practical non-monotonic modelling: on the need for selective model extension](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2019/proceedings/html/papers/Modelica2019paper3B1.pdf) published at the _13th International Modelica Conference 2019_. |

## Rationale
**SECTION TODO** Sketch of the proposal (especially with examples) and an explanation of the business case: Why should this feature be included? What problems can be solved (better) that cannot be solved (as easily) now? 
Provide at minimum two use cases for your proposal that show how it is applied. For each use case state how it could be implemented by current Modelica at best and why the current Modelica does not suffice for this application. 
Proposed Changes in Specification

The precise updated text of the specification is part of this branch/pull-request.

## Backwards Compatibility
**SECTION TODO** It has to be analyzed whether the proposal is backwards compatibile. If any possible, this should be the case. Even if it is backwards compatible, issues should be listed and analyzed that may cause problems. 

List (preferably existing) examples that would be corrupted by proposed changes in specification. 

Show what can be done about these cases. Provide a concept for a conversion script or any other solution. 

## Tool Implementation

### Dymola 2020 Prototype
A prototype of selective model extension has been developed by Dassault Systèmes AB, Lund. Selective extension is supported in _Dymola 2020_ in terms of tool vendor specific annotations for `extends`-clauses.

For example, to deselect the three connections `connect(voltageSensor.v, filter.u)`, `connect(speedSensor.w, setPointGain.u)` and `connect(voltageController.y, excitationVoltage.v)` of the `Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMEE_Rectifier` SMEE rectifier example of the Modelica Standard Library one annotates the respective `extends`-clause as follows:

```
extends Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMEE_Rectifier
    annotation(DiagramMap(__Dymola_deselect={
      "connect(voltageSensor.v, filter.u)",
      "connect(speedSensor.w, setPointGain.u)",
      "connect(voltageController.y, excitationVoltage.v)"}));
```

Likewise, components can be deselected via annotation. For example,

```
extends Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMEE_Rectifier
    annotation(DiagramMap(__Dymola_deselect={
      "voltageController",
      "setPointGain"}));
```

deselects the `Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.LimPID voltageController` and `Modelica.Blocks.Math.Gain setPointGain` components and all connections they are part of. Of course, connector and component deselections can be mixed.

The _Dymola 2020_ prototype is not feature complete. Besides realizing deselections using annotations instead of the proposed syntax, it does not check all proposed semantic constraints, particularly that deselected elements indeed exist. The resulting diagrams are correctly rendered however, such that deselected elements are not shown. GUI support to deselect from within the diagram-layer is not supported yet.

Implementing the _Dymola 2020_ prototype took very little effort; less than 50 lines of code have been required.

### Examples Library

A library with application examples is provided (`SelectiveExtension_13th_Modelica_Conference` library); different versions of it can be found in the [`examples`](examples) sub-directory. The contained examples are discussed in detail in the paper _Modelica language extensions for practical non-monotonic modelling: on the need for selective model extension_ (cf. _References_ Section); the conclusions drawn in the paper hold for all library versions.

The available versions are:

1. **Version 0.1.0** for _Dymola 2020_, based on `Modelica` 3.2.2 and `Modelica_Synchronous` 0.92.1.
2. **Version 0.2.0** for _Dymola 2020_, based on `Modelica` 3.2.3 and `Modelica_Synchronous` 0.93.0 (incorporates layout-adjustments for selective extensions of MSL base-classes whose layout changed from MSL 3.2.2 to 3.2.3, otherwise very same examples with the very same modeling as library version 0.1.0).

## Required Patents
To the best of our knowledge there are no patents required for implementation of this proposal.
