# Modelica Change Proposal MCP-0032: selective model extension

**Authors:** Christoff Bürger (Christoff.Buerger@3ds.com)

**(in development)**

The minutes of _Modelica Design Meetings_ discussing this MCP are summarized in [`minutes.md`](minutes.md).

## Summary
**SECTION TODO** Short description of the motivation and central idea of the proposal in 5 to 10 lines.

## Prerequisites

The MCP is based on the paper [_Modelica language extensions for practical non-monotonic modelling: on the need for selective model extension_](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2019/proceedings/html/papers/Modelica2019paper3B1.pdf) published at the _13th International Modelica Conference 2019_ (cf. Section _References_). The motivation, concepts and examples presented in that paper are considered to be know.

## Rationale

**SECTION TODO** Sketch of the proposal (especially with examples) and an explanation of the business case: Why should this feature be included? What problems can be solved (better) that cannot be solved (as easily) now? 
Provide at minimum two use cases for your proposal that show how it is applied. For each use case state how it could be implemented by current Modelica at best and why the current Modelica does not suffice for this application. 
Proposed Changes in Specification

The precise updated text of the specification is part of this branch/pull-request.

## Backwards compatibility
The proposed language extensions do not introduce any new keywords. The new context-free derivations for `extends`-clause modifications to deselect connections and components - using the proposed `break`-based syntax - are syntax errors in current Modelica. As a consequence, selective model extension never changes the semantic of existing valid Modelica 3.4 models.

Models that are syntactically invalid could theoretically become valid however, but chances are extremely low. It is not likely that a syntax error happens to satisfy the proposed syntax. It is even less likely that the respective model will further satisfy the semantic constraints of selective model extension _and_ Modelica. Particularly, on the one hand deselections must actually deselect something whereas at the same time it is close to impossible that _just_ deselecting something results in a valid model (consider that deselected elements are likely used somehow and are therefore missing in the resulting model because of existing Modelica well-formedness constraints like _“referenced components must be declared”_ and _“the system of equations must be well-defined”_).

## Tool implementation

### _Dymola 2020_ prototype
A prototype of selective model extension has been developed by _Dassault Systèmes AB, Lund_. Selective extension is supported in _Dymola 2020_ in terms of tool vendor specific annotations for `extends`-clauses.

For example, to deselect the three connections `connect(voltageSensor.v, filter.u)`, `connect(speedSensor.w, setPointGain.u)` and `connect(voltageController.y, excitationVoltage.v)` of the `Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMEE_Rectifier` SMEE rectifier example of the Modelica Standard Library one annotates the respective `extends`-clause as follows:

```
extends Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMEE_Rectifier
    annotation(DiagramMap(__Dymola_deselect={
      "connect(voltageSensor.v, filter.u)",
      "connect(speedSensor.w, setPointGain.u)",
      "connect(voltageController.y, excitationVoltage.v)"}));
```

Likewise, components can be deselected via annotation. For example,

```
extends Modelica.Electrical.Machines.Examples.SynchronousInductionMachines.SMEE_Rectifier
    annotation(DiagramMap(__Dymola_deselect={
      "voltageController",
      "setPointGain"}));
```

deselects the `Modelica.Blocks.Continuous.LimPID voltageController` and `Modelica.Blocks.Math.Gain setPointGain` components and all connections they are part of. Of course, connector and component deselections can be mixed.

The _Dymola 2020_ prototype is not feature complete. Besides realizing deselections using annotations instead of the proposed syntax, it does not check all proposed semantic constraints, particularly that deselected elements indeed exist. The resulting diagrams are correctly rendered however, such that deselected elements are not shown. GUI support to deselect from within the diagram-layer is not supported yet.

Implementing the _Dymola 2020_ prototype took very little effort; less than 50 lines of code have been required.

### _Dymola 2020 FD01_ prototype

A next prototype implementation supporting proper syntax for deselections instead of tool-vendor specific annotations is planned. It is scheduled to be part of _Dymola 2020 FD01_.

### Examples library

A library with application examples is provided (`SelectiveExtension_13th_Modelica_Conference` library); different versions of it can be found in the [`examples`](examples) sub-directory. The contained examples are discussed in detail in the paper _Modelica language extensions for practical non-monotonic modelling: on the need for selective model extension_ (cf. Section _References_); the conclusions drawn in the paper hold for all library versions.

The available versions are:

1. **Version 0.1.0** for _Dymola 2020_, based on `Modelica` 3.2.2 and `Modelica_Synchronous` 0.92.1 and using tool-vendor specific annotations for deselection.
2. **Version 0.2.0** for _Dymola 2020_, based on `Modelica` 3.2.3 and `Modelica_Synchronous` 0.93.0 and using tool-vendor specific annotations for deselection (incorporates layout-adjustments for selective extensions of MSL base-classes whose layout changed from MSL 3.2.2 to 3.2.3, otherwise very same examples with the very same modeling as in version 0.1.0).
